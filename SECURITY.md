## ‚ö†Ô∏è Antivirus False Positives

### Why Some Antivirus Software May Flag This Tool

**RDP Wrapper Installer** may trigger false positive detections from some antivirus software due to:

1. **PyInstaller Packaging** - Python executables are commonly flagged
2. **System Modifications** - The tool modifies Windows registry and system files
3. **Administrative Privileges** - Requires elevated permissions to function
4. **Network Downloads** - Downloads components from GitHub during installation
5. **Batch File Execution** - Runs .bat files as administrator

### üîç VirusTotal Analysis

Current detection status: **6/70+ engines** (typical for PyInstaller executables)

**Common False Positive Engines:**
- Generic heuristic scanners
- Behavior-based detection systems
- Engines that flag PyInstaller bootstraps

### ‚úÖ Verification Steps

To verify the safety of this tool:

1. **Source Code Review** - All source code is available in this repository
2. **Build Process** - Executable built with standard PyInstaller
3. **No Obfuscation** - Code is not obfuscated or packed maliciously
4. **Open Source** - MIT License, fully transparent

### üîí What This Tool Actually Does

**Registry Modifications:**
